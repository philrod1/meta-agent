Customer Refund for Digital Purchases

When a customer contacts support asking for a refund, we should check if they're eligible.
Refunds are normally allowed within 30 days of purchase, but there are exceptions.

If the customer has already downloaded the file, we still allow a refund if it was an accidental purchase, but that needs approval from a manager.

If there's a fraud warning on the account, stop immediately and report it to the fraud team.

Once eligibility is confirmed, we should issue the refund using the same payment method the customer used and let them know by email.
Finally, we should make sure we log everything for auditing purposes.

If anything goes wrong (e.g. payment system failure or missing data) the process should stop safely and record the reason.
