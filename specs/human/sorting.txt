I want to sort a large list of integers suing the workflow approach.
I want to implement a divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm using an Agent Workflow.
To solve the Sort Task, we need to determine if the list can be trivially sorted.  A single elemnt list is already sorted, so that would be a good choice.
If the list is of size 2, we can simply decide if we need to swap the element to get the correct order.
If the list is larger than two, we need to split the task into smaller (hopefully equal sized) sub-tasks.
Once we have all the trivial Tasks solved, we need to combine their results to build the sorted list at the top-level task.
